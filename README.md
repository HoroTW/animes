# Anime Watcher

Has a file to in which animes are listed that are currently being watched.
Checks if new episodes are available.
Generate a HTML page with the list of animes that have new episodes and the link to the anime.

Uses a rudimentary plugin system to add new sources.

## Usage
Just execute the Script and get a page with the series that have new episodes.

## Pull Requests are welcome
If you want to add a new source, you can do so by adding a plugin to the `plugins` directory.
The `bs_to.py` is just an example plugin. Please don't use it as a source for your animes.
I personally only use it to keep track of the progress of an anime.
